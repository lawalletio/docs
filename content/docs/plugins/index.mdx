> **PROPOSAL - NOT IMPLEMENTED**
>
> This documentation describes a **proposed plugin architecture** for LaWallet. These features are **not yet implemented** and are **not included in the current roadmap**. This is a community suggestion that may be developed as a contribution in the future.

---

## Overview

LaWallet can be extended through a plugin system that adds functionality without modifying the core application. Plugins are modular, opt-in features that enhance the LaWallet ecosystem.

## Proposed Plugin Architecture

```
LaWallet (core)
├── Plugin: Events
│   └── Create and manage community events with check-in
│
├── Plugin: Badges
│   └── Issue and verify Nostr badges for reputation
│
└── Plugin: Commerce
    └── Merchant directory with badge-based discounts
```

## Design Principles

1. **Non-invasive**: Plugins should not require changes to core LaWallet code
2. **Optional**: Users can enable/disable plugins as needed
3. **Interoperable**: Plugins communicate via Nostr events and Lightning payments
4. **Open**: Plugin specs are public, anyone can implement compatible services

## Proposed Plugins

| Plugin | Description | Status | Document |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------|
| [Events](./events) | Community event management with check-in and badge issuance | Proposal | [Events](./events) |
| [Badges](./badges) | Nostr badge system for reputation and rewards | Proposal | [Badges](./badges) |
| [Commerce](./commerce) | Merchant directory with badge-based discounts | Proposal | [Commerce](./commerce) |

## How Plugins Would Work

### Integration Points

Plugins would integrate with LaWallet through:

1. **Nostr Events**: Using NIPs for badges (NIP-58), events, and custom kinds
2. **Lightning Payments**: Zaps for rewards, payments for services
3. **UI Components**: Embeddable components for the LaWallet interface
4. **API Endpoints**: REST/WebSocket endpoints for plugin functionality

### Data Flow Example

```
User attends event
    │
    ▼
Check-in via QR/NFC (Events Plugin)
    │
    ▼
Badge issued to user's Nostr pubkey (Badges Plugin)
    │
    ▼
User visits merchant, scans wallet QR
    │
    ▼
Merchant reads badges, applies discount (Commerce Plugin)
    │
    ▼
Payment via Lightning with discount applied
```

## Contributing

These plugins are proposed as community contributions. If you're interested in implementing any of these features:

1. Review the individual plugin documentation
2. Open a discussion on the LaWallet repository
3. Submit a proposal with technical specifications
4. Implement and submit a pull request
